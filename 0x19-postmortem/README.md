Postmortem

Issue Summary

On January 24, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM PST, our main web application experienced a 50% decrease in performance, affecting approximately 30% of our users. Users reported slow page load times and occasional timeouts. The root cause was identified as a memory leak in one of our backend services.

Timeline

- 2:00 PM - The issue was first detected when our automated monitoring system alerted us to a significant increase in server memory usage.
- 2:15 PM - Initial investigation began, focusing on recent code deployments and database performance.
- 2:45 PM - The issue was escalated to the senior backend team after initial investigations did not reveal any significant findings.
- 3:00 PM - A misleading path was taken when the team suspected a recent feature deployment might be the cause. However, rolling back the feature did not resolve the issue.
- 3:30 PM - Further investigation revealed unusual memory consumption patterns in one of our backend services.
- 4:00 PM - The root cause was identified as a memory leak in the service.
- 4:30 PM - The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix to the service.

Root Cause and Resolution

The issue was caused by a memory leak in one of our backend services. This service was not properly releasing memory after processing user requests, leading to an accumulation of unused data in the server's memory, which eventually slowed down the application.

The issue was fixed by identifying the problematic code section and applying a hotfix to ensure proper memory management. The hotfix was tested in a staging environment before being deployed to production.

Corrective and Preventive Measures

To prevent this issue from recurring, we need to improve our code review and testing processes to catch potential memory leaks before deployment. We also need to enhance our monitoring system to detect unusual memory consumption patterns more effectively.

Specific tasks to address the issue include:

- Implement a code review checklist that includes checking for potential memory leaks.
- Add memory leak detection to our suite of automated tests.
- Upgrade our monitoring system to alert us when memory consumption patterns deviate from the norm.
- Conduct a thorough review of other backend services to ensure they are not susceptible to similar memory leaks.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and maintain the high performance and reliability our users expect from our service.
